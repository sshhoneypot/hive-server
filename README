Hive Server Readme

From the SSH Honeypot project
By: Truecode Pty Ltd

Please note, this package is in very early stages... still requires
lots of finalising and tidying.

Requires:
libpq (postgresql-devel)

Database:
Use the Postgresql database script hive.sql
createdb honeypot
psql honeypot < hive.sql


Compile:
gcc -o hive hive.c -lpq

Run:
./hive -d {demon mode}
./hive -h {help}

Check in the source for the PQconnect:
update with your db connection string.. if you have local TRUST
authentication, the connection string will probably work

To do:
# Add configuration file with options:
  port     {port to listen on}
  listen   {ips to accept packets from}
  database {database connection string} 
  ** expecting to use local TRUST authentication, not storing a password here

# Add options to send/receive blacklost from internation swarm

# Escape strings used in database queries

# Develop command set
  2 character command identifier
  char(5) is used as a field separator, 
  char(0) terminates
  ** 65 < host/username/password reporting packet
  Command needed to check if host is blacklisted (to be used by sshd)
  Commands also to replace current web based requests: password check, ip list

# Server is to provide integer return values to the client before
  dropping connection
